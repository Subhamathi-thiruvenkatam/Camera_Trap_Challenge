# Camera_Trap_Challenge

The primary objective of this project was to develop a code series capable of classifying and locating animals within a dataset comprising both daytime and night vision images captured by a camera. The dataset consisted of a diverse range of animal images, posing challenges related to variations in lighting conditions and the similar appearance of certain species.

## Binary Classification for Image analysis

In this code, the aim is to classify images into two classes (Badger or Deer). The model is trained on a dataset containing images of two different classes. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to use TensorFlow and Keras for building a deep learning model for binary image classification.

## Localization

This contains the code for implementing YOLOv5 for object detection and localization. The focus of this is on training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset and evaluating its performance in detecting and localizing objects in images.

## Classification

This code focuses on classifying animal images using the ResNet50 model. The dataset consists of images of animals, and the goal is to predict the class labels for each image. The classification task involves four classes. The code utilizes the ResNet50 architecture as a base model for feature extraction. The results provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
