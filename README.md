## Binary Classification for Image analysis
In this code, the aim is to classify images into two classes (Badger or Deer). The model is trained on a dataset containing images of two different classes. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to use TensorFlow and Keras for building a deep learning model for binary image classification.

## Localization
This contains the code for implementing YOLOv5 for object detection and localization. The focus of this is on training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset and evaluating its performance in detecting and localizing objects in images.
